The game is called Hyper-Snakes.

The player controls a snake with the use of the four arrow keys while avoiding obstacles such as:
1. The screen boundaries
2. Enemy objects that spawn from the corners
3. Bars that randomly spawn and randomly move 

The player dies if he collides with any of these obstacles

The player's objective is to collect the multi-colored food that gives him/her one point each. 

GOOD LUCK!
